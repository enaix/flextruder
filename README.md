Floating extruder upgrade for Anycubic i3 mega (Titan) with rigid design

## Required components

* Anycubic i3 mega-s (Titan extruder)
* 1x bearing (15 mm inner d., 35 mm outer d.)
* 20x M4 (4mm diameter, 1.5+ cm length) screws + nuts
* Washers for the left and right mounts
* Zipties
* ~1 meter of wire for the extruder cord
* Heat shrink for the wire

## Assembly

### Extruder cord

Cut 1 meter of the wire into 4 pieces (25 cm), cut the extruder cord into 2 pieces and solder the wires in between. Make sure to properly isolate the wires with the heat shrink.

### Main body

Download the latest STL parts from the Releases page, 3D print them (some of the parts need to be mirrored) and join them. Uninstall the extruder motor and mount the bracket to the 3D printer frame.

### Extruder

Mount the extruder on the rotating plate and install the bearing. Original bowden tube would need to be cut to much smaller length. Remove the zipties (including the one that holds the tube in the extruder) and cut the tube to the optimal length such that the printing head can manage to freely move along all positions of X and Z axes. Secure the tube with the zipties.

**Please check that 3D printer parts are not restricted in motion on X and Z axez**
